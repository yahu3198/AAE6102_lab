This repository is a lab work of AAE6102 Satellite Communication and Navigation from Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

This lab mainly focuses on setting up the linearized equations and solving user position and clock bias based on provided ephemeris data (eph.dat) and receiver data (rcvr.dat) by applying least-square estimation with pseudorange measurements.
